    <h2>Algebra</h2>
    <p>
      Algebra is the introduction to abstraction in math. Instead of writing all
      values explicitly, some values are replaced with symbols to mark unknowns.
      In this way, the core structure of the expression can be manipulated
      without concern for the actual values. An understanding of these abstract
      manipulations is key to success not only in mathematics, but also in
      logic, philosophy, and communication.

      In this chapter we focus on properties of expressions used frequently in
      algebra. This includes exponents, polynomials, rational expressions, and
      complex numbers.
