# Routes

That stuff is confusing. Let's clarify.

## Terminology

-   Route (React Component): wrapper object containing a path and a component. Contains logic for rendering the given component when user navigates to the given path.
-   Path (string): represents this route's "position" or "name"
-   Component (React Component): what is rendered when the user navigates to the path corresponding to this route
-   RouteObject (class): used for nesting routes and procedural route generation
